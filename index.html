                <title>What is scalability?</title>
                <div>

                    <q>Scalability is the capability of a system, network, or process to handle a growing amount of work, or its potential to be enlarged to accommodate that growth. For example, a system is considered scalable if it is capable of increasing
                        its total output under an increased load when resources (typically hardware) are added.</q>

                <h3>Properties of a system</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li> <b>Scalable</b>: a system whose performance improves after adding hardware, proportionally to the capacity added. </li>
                    <li> <b>Resilient or graceful degration</b>: a resilient control system is one that maintains state awareness and an accepted level of operational normalcy in response to disturbances. </li>
                    <li> <b>Distributed</b>: a distributed system is a model in which components located on networked computers communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages. </li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Distributed systems, degrees of parallelism.</h3>
                <p>We can design our application:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            To be executed concurrently.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Parallely.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Distributedly.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                        <p>Concurrent programming, the workload is scheduled in different threads that are time sliced or interleaved.</p>
                        <p>The execution of two blocks never overlaps.</p>
                        <p>In parallel computation execution occurs at the same physical instant. Parallel execution is impossible on a single processor machine</p>
                        <p>Distributed computation involves network traffic to coordinate the workload, and may or may not involve multiprocessor machines. In each machine parallel or concurrent execution could be done. </p>
